Okay, this is a challenging situation, but not impossible if we're *extremely strategic*. You won't become an ML expert in 3 days, but you can learn enough to understand and answer the most common questions from the PYQs.

**The Goal:** Understand the core concepts behind the frequently asked PYQ topics well enough to write coherent answers. We'll sacrifice depth for breadth on the *specific PYQ-relevant topics*.

**The Strategy:**
1.  **Focus ONLY on topics that have appeared in the PYQs you shared.**
2.  For each topic, aim for a high-level conceptual understanding: *What is it? Why is it used? What are its key components/steps? What are its main advantages/disadvantages if asked?*
3.  Use very short, targeted YouTube videos (search "X explained simply" or "X for beginners") and concise articles.
4.  Immediately after learning a concept, look at how it was asked in the PYQs and mentally (or by jotting down bullet points) frame an answer.

3.  **Identify weak spots:** If you can't outline an answer for a question, quickly re-watch a video or re-read notes for that specific micro-topic.
4.  **Prioritize:** If short on time, focus on outlining answers for the most frequently asked topics (NNs, RL, Bayes).

**Final Tips for the 3 Days:**
*   **Stay Calm:** Panicking won't help.
*   **Sleep:** Get at least 6-7 hours. Your brain needs it to consolidate learning.
*   **Short Breaks:** Every hour, take a 5-10 minute break.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively watch videos. Take notes. Try to explain concepts back to yourself.
*   **Don't Aim for Perfection:** Aim for "good enough to pass" on the most common topics.
*   **During the Exam:**
    *   Read all questions carefully.
    *   Start with questions you feel most confident about.
    *   Even if you don't know everything, write down what you *do* know about the topic. Partial credit is possible.
    *   Use diagrams if they help explain CNN/RNN architectures.

This is a very aggressive plan. Stick to it as closely as possible. Good luck! You can do this!
