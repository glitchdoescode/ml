# Support Vector Machines (SVM): Maximizing the Margin (PYQ 7a - May 2024, PYQ 7a - 2022, PYQ 8b - CBGS)

## 1. What are Support Vector Machines (SVMs)?

**Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** are powerful and versatile supervised machine learning algorithms used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. However, they are most widely known and used for classification.

**Core Idea:** The fundamental idea behind SVM for classification is to find an optimal **hyperplane** in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points. The "optimal" hyperplane is the one that has the **largest margin** between the data points of different classes.

**Analogy: Finding the Widest Street**
Imagine you have data points for two classes (e.g., red dots and blue dots) scattered on a 2D plane. SVM tries to find the straight line (which is a hyperplane in 2D) that best separates these dots. Not just any line, but the line that is as far as possible from the closest red dot and the closest blue dot. This "as far as possible" distance is the margin. The wider the street (margin), the better the separation.

## 2. Key Concepts in SVM

### a) Hyperplane
*   **Definition:** A decision boundary that separates the space into different regions, one for each class.
    *   In a 2-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a line.
    *   In a 3-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a plane.
    *   In spaces with more than 3 dimensions, it's called a hyperplane.
*   **Equation (Linear Hyperplane):** `w · x + b = 0`
    *   `w`: Weight vector (a vector perpendicular/normal to the hyperplane).
    *   `x`: Input feature vector.
    *   `b`: Bias term (offsets the hyperplane from the origin).
*   Data points are classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall: `w · x + b > 0` for one class, and `w · x + b < 0` for the other.

### b) Margin
*   **Definition:** The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from either class. These closest points are called support vectors.
*   **Goal of SVM:** To find the hyperplane that **maximizes this margin**. A larger margin generally leads to better generalization performance on unseen data, as it implies a more confident and robust separation.
*   The margin is defined by two parallel hyperplanes: `w · x + b = 1` and `w · x + b = -1`. The distance between these two is `2 / ||w||` (where `||w||` is the norm or magnitude of the weight vector).

### c) Support Vectors
*   **Definition:** The data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) or on the margin.
*   **Critical Role:** These are the most important data points in the training set because they directly define the position and orientation of the optimal hyperplane.
    *   If other (non-support vector) data points are moved or removed (as long as they don't cross the margin), the optimal hyperplane will not change.
    *   If a support vector is moved, the hyperplane will likely change.
*   This property makes SVMs memory efficient, as only the support vectors are needed to define the decision boundary after training.

### d) Maximal Margin Classifier
*   The hyperplane chosen by SVM, which has the largest possible margin, is called the maximal margin classifier.

## 3. How SVMs Work: Linear SVM

### a) Linearly Separable Data
If the data points of different classes can be perfectly separated by a straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions), the data is called **linearly separable**.

For linearly separable data, SVM finds the unique hyperplane that maximizes the margin. The decision function is:
`f(x) = sign(w · x + b)`

### b) Mathematical Formulation (Intuition)
To find the maximal margin hyperplane, SVM solves an optimization problem:

*   **Objective:** Maximize the margin `2 / ||w||`. This is equivalent to **minimizing `||w||`**, or more commonly, minimizing `(1/2) ||w||^2` (for mathematical convenience, as it's a quadratic programming problem).

*   **Constraints:** Ensure that all data points are correctly classified and are on the correct side of their respective margin boundaries.
    For each data point `x_i` with class label `y_i` (where `y_i = +1` for one class and `y_i = -1` for the other):
    *   `y_i (w · x_i + b) ≥ 1`

This constraint means:
*   If `y_i = +1`, then `w · x_i + b ≥ 1` (points of class +1 are on or beyond the positive margin boundary).
*   If `y_i = -1`, then `w · x_i + b ≤ -1` (points of class -1 are on or beyond the negative margin boundary).

This formulation is for the "hard margin" SVM, which assumes perfect linear separability.

## 4. Non-Linearly Separable Data & The Kernel Trick

Real-world data is often not perfectly linearly separable.

### a) Soft Margin SVM
*   **Problem:** What if data cannot be perfectly separated by a hyperplane, or if we want a more robust model that allows for some misclassifications to achieve a wider margin?
*   **Solution:** Introduce **slack variables (`ξ_i` - xi)** for each data point `x_i`. These slack variables measure the degree of misclassification or how far a point is on the wrong side of its margin.
    *   `ξ_i ≥ 0`.
    *   If `ξ_i = 0`, the point is correctly classified and on or beyond its margin.
    *   If `0 < ξ_i ≤ 1`, the point is within the margin but still on the correct side of the hyperplane.
    *   If `ξ_i > 1`, the point is misclassified (on the wrong side of the hyperplane).

*   **Modified Constraints:** `y_i (w · x_i + b) ≥ 1 - ξ_i`

*   **Modified Objective Function:** Minimize `(1/2) ||w||^2 + C * Σ_i ξ_i`
    *   `C`: A **regularization parameter** (hyperparameter) that controls the trade-off between:
        1.  **Maximizing the margin** (small `||w||^2`).
        2.  **Minimizing the sum of slack variables** (minimizing misclassifications or margin violations).
    *   **Large `C`:** Penalizes misclassifications more heavily. Leads to a smaller margin, trying to fit the training data more precisely (can lead to overfitting if `C` is too large).
    *   **Small `C`:** Allows more misclassifications in favor of a wider margin (can lead to underfitting if `C` is too small, but often better generalization).

### b) The Kernel Trick (for Non-Linear SVM)
*   **Problem:** Data might be inherently non-linear, such that no straight line/hyperplane can separate it well in its original feature space (e.g., data arranged in concentric circles).
*   **Idea:** Map the data from the original low-dimensional feature space to a **higher-dimensional feature space** where it *becomes* linearly separable (or at least more easily separable).
*   **Challenge:** Explicitly computing these high-dimensional transformations can be computationally very expensive or even intractable.

*   **Solution: The Kernel Trick**
    *   Kernel functions (`K(x_i, x_j)`) allow SVMs to operate in this high-dimensional space **without explicitly computing the coordinates** of the data points in that space.
    *   Instead, kernels directly compute the **dot product** of the images of the data points in the high-dimensional space: `K(x_i, x_j) = φ(x_i) · φ(x_j)`, where `φ(x)` is the transformation to the higher-dimensional space.
    *   The SVM algorithm only needs these dot products, not the explicit `φ(x)` transformations.

*   **Common Kernel Functions:**
    1.  **Linear Kernel:** `K(x_i, x_j) = x_i · x_j`
        *   This is the standard SVM for linearly separable data (no transformation).
    2.  **Polynomial Kernel:** `K(x_i, x_j) = (γ * (x_i · x_j) + r)^d`
        *   Maps data to a `d`-dimensional polynomial space.
        *   `γ` (gamma), `r` (coefficient), and `d` (degree) are hyperparameters.
    3.  **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel / Gaussian Kernel:** `K(x_i, x_j) = exp(-γ * ||x_i - x_j||^2)`
        *   A very popular and powerful kernel. It can map data to an infinitely dimensional space.
        *   `γ` (gamma) is a hyperparameter. A small `γ` means a larger variance (smoother boundary), and a large `γ` means a smaller variance (more complex, wiggly boundary).
        *   Effectively, the decision boundary depends on the distance of points from each other.
    4.  **Sigmoid Kernel:** `K(x_i, x_j) = tanh(γ * (x_i · x_j) + r)`
        *   Can behave like a two-layer neural network.

*   **Impact:** By using kernels, SVMs can learn complex, non-linear decision boundaries.

## 5. Advantages of SVMs

*   **Effective in High-Dimensional Spaces:** Works well even when the number of dimensions (features) is greater than the number of samples.
*   **Memory Efficient:** Uses only a subset of training points (the support vectors) in the decision function, making it memory efficient once trained.
*   **Versatile:** Different kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it's also possible to specify custom kernels.
*   **Good Generalization Performance:** The margin maximization objective helps in finding a decision boundary that is likely to generalize well to unseen data, especially when there's a clear margin of separation.
*   **Robust to Overfitting (especially with proper `C` and kernel choice):** Due to margin maximization and the soft margin concept.

## 6. Disadvantages of SVMs

*   **Computationally Intensive for Large Datasets:** Training time complexity can be high (e.g., between O(n^2) and O(n^3) for some implementations, where n is the number of samples). Not ideal for very large datasets.
*   **Choice of Kernel and Hyperparameters:** Performance heavily depends on the choice of the kernel function and its parameters (e.g., `C` for soft margin, `γ` for RBF kernel). This often requires careful tuning (e.g., using cross-validation).
*   **Less Intuitive / "Black Box":** The resulting model, especially with non-linear kernels, can be difficult to interpret directly compared to models like decision trees.
*   **No Direct Probability Estimates:** Standard SVMs output class labels (+1 or -1). While probabilities can be estimated (e.g., using Platt scaling), it's an additional step and not inherent to the model.
*   **Sensitive to Feature Scaling:** It's recommended to scale features (e.g., to [0,1] or with zero mean and unit variance) before training an SVM.

## 7. Applications of SVMs

SVMs have been successfully applied to a wide range of classification problems:
*   **Image Classification:** Object recognition, face detection.
*   **Text Categorization:** Classifying documents into different topics, sentiment analysis.
*   **Bioinformatics:** Protein classification, cancer classification based on gene expression data.
*   **Handwriting Recognition.**
*   **Spam Detection.**
*   **Medical Diagnosis.**

## 8. Summary for Exams
