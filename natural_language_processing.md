# Natural Language Processing (NLP) (PYQ 8.4 - 2024, PYQ 8iv - 2022, PYQ 8a(i) - CBGS)

## 1. What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), computer science, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

It involves developing algorithms and models that allow machines to:
*   **Understand Text and Speech:** Process and make sense of written or spoken language.
*   **Generate Text and Speech:** Produce human-like language, either written or spoken.
*   **Extract Information:** Identify and pull out key pieces of information from text.
*   **Translate Languages:** Convert text from one language to another.
*   **Engage in Dialogue:** Communicate with humans in a conversational manner.

NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## 2. Key Tasks and Applications of NLP

NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks and has numerous real-world applications:

**Core NLP Tasks:**

1.  **Text Preprocessing:** Preparing raw text data for NLP models. This is a crucial first step.
    *   **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into smaller units (words, subwords, or characters) called tokens.
        *   *Example:* "NLP is fascinating!" -> ["NLP", "is", "fascinating", "!"]
    *   **Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
    *   **Stop Word Removal:** Removing common words (like "the", "is", "a", "an") that often don't carry significant meaning for a specific task.
    *   **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root or base form by chopping off suffixes (e.g., "running" -> "run"). It's a crude heuristic.
    *   **Lemmatization:** Similar to stemming, but more sophisticated. It considers the word's meaning (lemma) and uses a vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the dictionary form of a word (e.g., "ran" -> "run", "better" -> "good").
    *   **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assigning grammatical categories (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.
        *   *Example:* "The cat sat." -> [("The", DET), ("cat", NOUN), ("sat", VERB)]
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, etc.
        *   *Example:* "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino on April 1, 1976." -> (Apple Inc.: ORG), (Steve Jobs: PER), (Cupertino: LOC), (April 1, 1976: DATE)

2.  **Language Modeling:**
    *   Predicting the probability of a sequence of words. This is fundamental to many NLP tasks, like speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation.
    *   *Example:* Given "The cat sat on the ___", a language model might predict "mat" or "couch" with high probability.

3.  **Text Classification / Categorization:**
    *   Assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   **Spam Detection:** Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a text (e.g., product review, tweet).
        *   **Topic Modeling/Classification:** Identifying the main topic(s) of a document (e.g., sports, politics, technology).

4.  **Machine Translation (MT):**
    *   Automatically translating text or speech from one natural language to another.
    *   *Examples:* Google Translate, DeepL.

5.  **Information Retrieval (IR):**
    *   Finding relevant documents or information from a large collection (corpus) based on a user's query.
    *   *Examples:* Search engines like Google, searching for specific documents in a database.

6.  **Question Answering (QA):**
    *   Providing answers to questions posed by humans in natural language, often by querying a knowledge base or a given context document.
    *   *Examples:* Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), chatbots answering FAQs.

7.  **Text Summarization:**
    *   Generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document while preserving its main ideas.
    *   **Extractive Summarization:** Selects important sentences directly from the original text.
    *   **Abstractive Summarization:** Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text (more human-like but harder).

8.  **Text Generation:**
    *   Creating new text that is coherent and contextually relevant.
    *   *Examples:* Story writing, poetry generation, code generation, dialogue generation for chatbots.

9.  **Speech Recognition (ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition):**
    *   Converting spoken language into written text. (Often considered a separate field but heavily intertwined with NLP for understanding the transcribed text).

10. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) / Speech Synthesis:**
    *   Converting written text into spoken language. (Similar to ASR, often separate but related).

**Popular Applications:**
*   **Virtual Assistants & Chatbots:** (e.g., Siri, Alexa, customer service bots)
*   **Search Engines:** (e.g., Google, Bing)
*   **Social Media Monitoring:** Analyzing trends, sentiment, and public opinion.
*   **Healthcare:** Analyzing medical records, drug discovery, clinical trial matching.
*   **Finance:** Sentiment analysis for stock prediction, fraud detection, regulatory compliance.
*   **Education:** Automated essay grading, intelligent tutoring systems.

## 3. Core Machine Learning Techniques Used in NLP

Machine learning, especially deep learning, has become the dominant approach in NLP.

**Traditional ML Approaches (still used for some tasks or as baselines):**
*   **Naive Bayes:** Often used for text classification (e.g., spam detection) due to its simplicity and efficiency.
*   **Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Effective for text classification tasks.
*   **Logistic Regression:** Another common choice for text classification.
*   **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Historically used for POS tagging and speech recognition.
*   **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):** Used for sequential labeling tasks like NER and POS tagging.
*   **Word Representations (Pre-Deep Learning):**
    *   **Bag-of-Words (BoW):** Represents text as an unordered collection of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of frequency.
    *   **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** A numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It increases with word frequency in a document but is offset by the word's frequency in the corpus.

**Deep Learning Approaches (State-of-the-art for most NLP tasks):**

*   **Word Embeddings (Dense Word Representations):** These capture semantic relationships between words by representing them as dense vectors in a low-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings have similar vector representations.
    *   **Word2Vec (Skip-gram, CBOW):** Learns word embeddings by predicting context words or a target word from its context.
    *   **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation):** Learns embeddings based on global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.
    *   **FastText:** Extends Word2Vec by representing each word as a bag of character n-grams. This allows it to generate embeddings for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed to process sequential data like text.
    *   **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) & GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units):** Variants of RNNs that can capture long-range dependencies in text by using gating mechanisms to control information flow. Widely used for language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, etc.

*   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** While known for vision, CNNs can be applied to text (e.g., by sliding filters over word embeddings) to capture local patterns (n-grams) for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.

*   **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models:** An architecture consisting of an encoder (processes input sequence) and a decoder (generates output sequence). Used for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.
    *   Often built using RNNs (LSTMs/GRUs).

*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Enhance Seq2Seq models by allowing the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output. This is crucial for handling long sequences and improving performance in tasks like machine translation and summarization.

*   **Transformers:** A revolutionary architecture (introduced in "Attention Is All You Need") that relies entirely on **self-attention mechanisms** to process sequences, dispensing with recurrence. Transformers can process words in parallel, making them highly efficient and effective at capturing long-range dependencies.
    *   **Key Components:** Self-attention, multi-head attention, positional encodings.
    *   **Pre-trained Transformer Models:** These models are trained on massive text corpora (like Wikipedia, books) and can then be fine-tuned for specific downstream NLP tasks. They have achieved state-of-the-art results across a wide range of benchmarks.
        *   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Learns deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. Excellent for understanding tasks.
        *   **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** Autoregressive language model, excellent for text generation tasks.
        *   **RoBERTa, XLNet, ALBERT, T5, BART:** Other influential Transformer-based models with variations in pre-training objectives and architectures.

## 4. Challenges in NLP

*   **Ambiguity:** Natural language is often ambiguous at different levels (lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic).
    *   *Lexical:* "bank" (river bank vs. financial institution).
    *   *Syntactic:* "I saw a man on a hill with a telescope." (Who has the telescope?)
*   **Scale and Variability:** The sheer volume of text data and the vast number of ways to express the same idea.
*   **Context Dependence:** Meaning is heavily dependent on context, which can be hard for models to capture fully.
*   **Informal Language & Noise:** Slang, misspellings, grammatical errors, emojis in social media text.
*   **Common Sense Reasoning:** Machines lack real-world knowledge and common sense, which is often implicit in human language.
*   **Low-Resource Languages:** Many NLP techniques require large amounts of labeled data, which is not available for most of the world's languages.
*   **Bias:** Models can learn and amplify societal biases present in training data.
*   **Evaluation:** Evaluating the quality of generated text or understanding can be subjective and challenging.
